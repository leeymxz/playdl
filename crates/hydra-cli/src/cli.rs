/// The grammar enforced, from RFC 9110 §5:
///
///   field-line = field-name ":" OWS field-value OWS
///   field-name = token
///   token      = 1*tchar
///
/// A value need not follow a space (`X-Trace:1` is fine). What is refused is an
/// empty or non-token field-name, and any CR or LF anywhere — the last being
/// header injection rather than a typo, since a newline in a value lets a caller
/// append arbitrary extra fields to the request.
///
/// **A field-name with no VALUE is a QUERY, not a header to send** — `ETag` and
/// `ETag:` alike. Those are split out by [`Cli::parse_with_queries`] before this
/// parser runs, so everything reaching here carries a value and is destined for
/// the wire.
/// Validate a `--checksum` spec at parse time.
///
/// Accepts `md5:`, `sha1:`, `sha256:` and `sha512:`, or a bare hex digest whose
/// algorithm is inferred from its width. Normalised to `algo:hex`, which is what
/// the comparison downstream understands and is the same spelling a Metalink
/// digest arrives in.
///
/// # Why md5 and sha1 are accepted
///
/// Not because they are sound against an adversary — they are not. Because they
/// are frequently all a project publishes, especially in the Metalink 3.0
/// documents distribution mirrors still emit, and refusing them does not make
/// anyone safer: it replaces an integrity check that catches a truncating proxy,
/// a stale mirror and a corrupted transfer with no check at all.
///
/// Validating HERE rather than at comparison time is the point. An unparsable
/// value used to survive as far as the digest check, fail it, and be reported as
/// `checksum MISMATCH: the delivered bytes are not the bytes requested` — which
/// accuses the server of serving wrong bytes when the argument itself was
/// malformed. The exit code was right and the diagnosis was wrong, which is the
/// more expensive half. `--limit-rate` and `--range` are already validated at
/// parse time; this brings `--checksum` in line with them.
