//! Politeness: pacing, rate limiting, and server-friendly connection management.
//!
//! Features:
//! * Per-host connection ceilings suitable for public mirrors;
//! * `Retry-After` parsing (both delta-seconds and HTTP-date forms) with
//!   exponential backoff and jitter for 429/503 responses;
//! * Token-bucket rate limiter for bandwidth throttling;
//! * Bounded redirect handling with validation at each hop.
//!
//! The defaults here are deliberately conservative. A user who wants to saturate
