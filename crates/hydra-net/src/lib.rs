//! HTTP/1.1 range transport driving the `hydra-core` scheduler.
//!
//! Deliberately minimal: a hand-rolled HTTP/1.1 client over `tokio::net::TcpStream`,
//! because the point of this crate is to show that the scheduler core needs
//! nothing from the transport but *bytes arrived* and *when*. The same core runs
//! under the discrete-event simulator with no changes.
//!
//! Two properties the harness measures:
//!
//! * **Memory is independent of object size.** Bytes are written to their file
//!   offset as they arrive (positioned write, `pwrite`), never buffered whole and
//!   never reassembled. Resident memory is `O(connections × buffer)`.
//! * **The scheduler is I/O-free.** Everything in `hydra-core` is driven by
//!   `on_bytes` / `tick`; this crate contains all the syscalls.
//!
//! # Where SIMD is and is not used
//!
//! Three byte-parallel paths matter here, and each gets its vectorization from a
//! different place — deliberately, because hand-written intrinsics are a
//! maintenance and correctness cost that has to be paid for by a measurement:
//!
//! * **Byte search** (`find_crlf`, `find_crlf2`, [`framebuf::FrameBuf`]) uses
//!   `memchr`, which does runtime feature detection and dispatch: AVX2 or SSE2
//!   on x86-64, NEON on aarch64, scalar elsewhere. One binary is correct and
//!   fast on every target, with no `unsafe` in this crate.
//! * **Hex encoding** ([`digest::to_lower_hex`]) is a table lookup over a
//!   preallocated buffer, shaped so LLVM autovectorizes it for whatever
//!   `target-cpu` the build selects. Measured 11.8x over the `write!` form it
//!   replaced, which is all the gain intrinsics could have bought.
//! * **Hashing and erasure coding** are delegated: `sha2` dispatches to SHA-NI
//!   on x86-64 and the ARMv8 SHA-2 extensions via `cpufeatures`, `blake3` to
//!   AVX2/AVX-512/NEON, and `reed-solomon-simd` to its own kernels. These are
//!   the genuinely compute-bound operations and they are already
//!   hardware-accelerated by crates that test those paths on real silicon.
//!
//! Vectorized paths are covered by differential tests against scalar references,
//! maintaining safety and high performance across architectures.

/// nothing: an HTTP range request names both ends, and the far end is enforced
/// by the client, so the client can simply decide to stop earlier and the server
/// is never told. No cancellation, no round trip.
///
/// That is a true statement about HTTP and it was a false statement about this
/// code. `fetch_range` used to take `hi: u64` by value, so the fetch loop tested
/// `off < hi` against a snapshot taken when the task was spawned. A repair moved
/// the scheduler's copy of the range and the running task never learned: the
/// victim went on requesting — and receiving — the exact span that had just been
/// handed to somebody else. Both connections pulled it, over one bottleneck,
/// and the resulting slowdown looked to the scheduler like fresh divergence,
/// which triggered another repair. At n=8 that loop turned 0 necessary repairs
/// into 32-49 and cost ~2.2x the fluid optimum.
///
/// Making the bound an `AtomicU64` behind an `Arc` is what makes preemption cost
/// what the theory says it costs. It is read once per `read()` — a relaxed load
/// against a 64 KiB buffer fill, which is not measurable next to the syscall.
///
/// # What "free" honestly means
///
/// Free on the wire, not free in bytes already in flight. When the loop stops at
/// the lowered bound, the server is still sending toward the original end, so up
/// to roughly one bandwidth-delay product may already be in the socket and is
/// discarded when the stream drops. That is bounded by the receive window and
/// does not scale with the size of the span given away, which is the whole
/// difference between this and re-requesting.
