//! The download engine bridge: GUI on one side, `hya-core`/`hya-net` on the
//! other.
//!
//! One background thread runs a tokio runtime that owns every transfer. The
//! GUI talks to it through a command channel and hears back through an event
//! channel that an iced subscription drains, so the widget tree never blocks
//! on a socket and the engine never touches a widget.
//!
//! Transfer strategy follows what the CLI settled on:
//! range-capable origins get the `hya-core` scheduler with N connections
//! (default 8) and the stall-timeout clamp measured there; servers
//! without ranges fall back to one streaming GET. Pause/cancel go through
//! `run_transfer_cancellable`'s stop flag so sockets actually close, and the
//! received spans are re-`mark_done`d on resume — including across app restarts.
